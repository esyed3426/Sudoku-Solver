I used Python to create a Sudoku solver by using a backtracking algorithm. 

My approach:

1. Find an empty space 
2. Insert a number
3. Check if that number is valid
4. Repeat

*** If the number is not valid, backtrack to the previous number and try different numbers ***

Determine if a number is valid by checking if it appears in each row, column and box. 
Recursively determine if a solution is valid by checking if it can create a valid solution.
